### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**This project is currently under active development.**

Syfen-TFT aims to be an ADB Pytesseract bot specifically designed for **Teamfight Tactics (TFT)**.  
It is intended for developers who are interested in contributing to the creation of a bot. The project will utilize **Pytesseract** for fast and efficient text recognition during gameplay, and the emulator resolution is planned to be **1280x720** to enable faster image processing.

To ensure every function operates independently and can be adjusted easily, the bot will first be developed as separate, self-contained modules within the `/debug-tools` directory. Only after each module is verified for functionality and adaptability will they be integrated into a unified system.
